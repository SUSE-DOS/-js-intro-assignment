Understanding how Javascript interprets string and number variables.

#### Is there anything you would like more information on?

Understanding how Javascript interprets string and number variables. I was very confused as to when two variables that represent numbers were concatenated like strings instead of summed.
```

#### Do you have any suggestions to improve this assignment?

```
This assignment was provided before any overview learning class of the infrastructure of javascript behaviour within codesandbox. The entire lesson was focused on the developer console in Google Chrome. I would have prefered understanding how the infrastructure of implementing the script tag and linking javascript files in codesandbox is undertaken first. Even a brief overview of javascript in codesandbox would have really helped and I would have avoided wasting time and overscoping the assignment, trying to figure out things that should have been shown in class.
